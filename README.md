## Caesar Cipher

### Description
This Python script implements the Caesar cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### Usage
1. **Run the script:** Execute the Python script.
2. **Input message:** Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. **Input key:** Enter the shift value (key) for the cipher.
4. **Output:** The script will display both the encrypted and decrypted messages.

### How it works
* Takes user input for the message and the key.
* Encrypts the message by shifting each letter by the specified key value.
* Decrypts the encrypted message by shifting each letter back by the key value.
* Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.x

### Additional Notes
* The script assumes a standard English alphabet.
* For more complex ciphers or real-world applications, stronger encryption methods should be considered.

### Example
```
Enter the message: HELLO
Enter the key: 3

Encrypted message: KHOOR
Decrypted message: HELLO
```

**Enjoy experimenting with the Caesar cipher!**
